                With a busy life and career, the idea of a Contact Manager that would make it easier for us to stay in
                touch with people was an easy one. So we built ReeContact, a Contact Manager that helps you to better
                stay in touch with the people you care about. It offers a fine-grained priority system as well as
                extensive note-taking capabilities make things easier for you even with a busy life.

                Originally built for Android in 2014, this project has managed to gain a lot of traction in the shaving
                enthusiast community by allowing people to track their collection, log and evaluate shaves and share
                them with
                the community. More recently, this project has been upgraded to reflect our extended knowledge and will
                soon be
                available not only for Android, but also iOS!
